Documenting research/development and data for the AML(Acute Myeloid Leukemia) Research Project. The AML Research Project is open source and free to use ([LICENSE](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Classifiers/blob/master/LICENSE "LICENSE")) with the goals of researching and developing various Artificial Intelligence to help detect AML and discover new drugs.

The AML Research Project is being organized and developed by a team of volunteers with experience in Leukemia research, computer vision, biochemistry & molecular biophysics among other areas of expertise. The team is currently made up of:

- [Adam Milton-Barker](https://github.com/AdamMiltonBarker "Adam Milton-Barker") - Bigfinite IoT Network Engineer & Intel Software Innovator.
- [Ho Leung Ng](https://github.com/holeung "Ho  Leung Ng") - Kansas State University, Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics.
- John LaRocco - Former Humai Head of Engineering, LA, USA.
- [Amita Kapoor](https://github.com/amita-kapoor "Amita Kapoor") - Associate Professor @ Delhi University, New Dehli, India.

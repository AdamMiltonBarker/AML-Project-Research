Documenting project research and data for the Peter Moss Acute Myeloid Leukemia Research Project. Project is an open source and free project with the goals of researching and developing various Artificial Intelligence to help detect AML and discover new drugs.

The project is being organized and developed by a group of volunteers with experience in Leukemia research, computer vision and Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics among other areas of expertise. 

The group is currently made up of:

- Adam Milton-Barker - Bigfinite IoT Network Engineer & Intel Software Innovator.
- Ho  Leung Ng - Kansas State University, Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics.
- John LaRocco  -  Professor @ Miskatonic University, Arkham, Massachusetts 

With access to the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing data set provided by Fabio Scotti - Associate Professor @ Università degli Studi di Milano

# Project Roadmap

- Convolutional Neural Networks for early detection.
- Genetic Algorithms for drug discovery.
